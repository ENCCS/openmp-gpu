Introduction
------------
Why use GPUs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. figure:: img/comparison.png
   :align: center
   
   The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) provides much higher instruction throughput and memory bandwidth than the CPU within a similar price and power envelope.
What is different?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. figure:: img/gpu_vs_cpu.png
   :align: center
   
   The GPU is specialized for highly parallel computations and therefore designed such that more transistors are devoted to data processing rather than data caching and flow control.

     - Great for data parallelism
   * - Low latency per thread
     - High-throughput
   * - Large area dedicated cache and control
     - Hundreds of floating-point execution units

Some source code
----------------

Sometimes we need to look at code, which can be in the webpage and optionally
you can pull out only some lines, or highlight others. Make sure both C++ and Fortran examples exist and work.

.. typealong:: The field data structure

   .. tabs::

      .. tab:: C++

         .. literalinclude:: code-samples/serial/heat.h
                        :language: cpp
                        :lines: 7-17
                                
      .. tab:: Fortran

         .. literalinclude:: code-samples/serial/fortran/heat_mod.F90
                        :language: fortran
                        :lines: 9-15

Building the code
-----------------

If there's terminal output to discuss, show something like::

  nvc++ -g -O3 -fopenmp -Wall -I../common -c main.cpp -o main.o
  nvc++ -g -O3 -fopenmp -Wall -I../common -c core.cpp -o core.o
  nvc++ -g -O3 -fopenmp -Wall -I../common -c setup.cpp -o setup.o
  nvc++ -g -O3 -fopenmp -Wall -I../common -c utilities.cpp -o utilities.o
  nvc++ -g -O3 -fopenmp -Wall -I../common -c io.cpp -o io.o
  nvc++ -g -O3 -fopenmp -Wall -I../common main.o core.o setup.o utilities.o io.o ../common/pngwriter.o -o heat_serial  -lpng


Running the code
----------------

To show a sample command line, use this approach

.. code-block:: bash

   ./heat_serial 800 800 1000

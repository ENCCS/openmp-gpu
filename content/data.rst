data mapping
------------------
Due to distinct memory spaces on host and device, transferring data becomes inevitable. The map cluase on a device construct explicitly specifies how items  are mapped from the host to the device data environment.  The common mapped items consist of  arrays(array sections), scalars, pointers, and structure elements.
The various forms of the map cluase are summarised in the following table


.. csv-table::
   :widths: auto
   :delim: ;

   ``map([map-type]:list)`` ; :doc:`map clause`
   ``map(to:list)`` ; :doc:`On entering the region, variables in the list are initialized on the device using the original values from the host`
   ``map(from:list)`` ;  :doc:`At the end of the target region, the values from variables in the list are copied into the original variables on the host. On entering the region, the initial value of the variables on the device is not initialized`       
   ``map(tofrom:list)`` ; :doc:`the effect of both a map-to and a map-from`
   ``map(alloc:list)`` ;  :doc:`On entering the region, data is allocated and uninitialized on the device`
   ``map(list)`` ; :doc:`equivalent to ``map(tofrom:list)```


.. note::

	When mapping data arrays or pointers, be careful about the array section notation:
	  - In C/C++: array[lower-bound:length]
	  - In Fortran:array[lower-bound:upper-bound]
	



data region
------------------
How the target construct  creates storage, transfer data, and remove storage on the device  are clasiffied as two categories:  structured data region and unstructured data region.

Structured Data Regions
------------------
The target data construct is used to create a structured data region which is convenient for providing persistent data on the device which could be used for subseqent target constructs.

Unstructured Data Regions
------------------
The unstructured data constructs have much more freedom in creating and deleting of data on the device at any appropriate point.

Optimize Data Transfers
------------------
 - Reduce the amount of data mapping between host and device
 - Try to keep data environment residing on the target device as long as possible
